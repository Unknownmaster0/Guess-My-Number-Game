# Guess My Number

## Description
**Guess My Number** is a simple game where the system generates a random number between 1 and 20, and the user has to predict the correct number. The game provides hints to help the user:

- If the guessed number is too high, a message will indicate that the guess is too high.
- If the guessed number is too low, the message will inform the user that the guess is too low.

### Game Features
- **Score System**: Each player starts with a score of 10. For every incorrect guess, 1 point is deducted. If the score reaches 0 before the correct number is guessed, the player loses the game.
- **Play Again Button**: The game includes a "Play Again" button that resets the game, allowing the player to start over and try again.

### Winning or Losing
- If the player guesses the correct number before losing all points, they win.
- If the player's score drops to 0, they lose the game.
